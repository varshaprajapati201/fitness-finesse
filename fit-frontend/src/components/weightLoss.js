                <div className="weightLossIntro">
                    <p>It’s estimated that nearly half of American adults attempt to lose weight each year (1Trusted Source).

                        One of the best ways to lose weight is by changing your diet.

                        Yet, the sheer number of available diet plans may make it difficult to get started, as you’re unsure which one is most suitable, sustainable, and effective.

                        Some diets aim to curb your appetite to reduce your food intake, while others suggest restricting your intake of calories and either carbs or fat.

                        What’s more, many offer health benefits that go beyond weight loss.

                        Here are the 8 best diet plans to help you shed weight and improve your overall health.</p>
                </div>

                <div className="weightLossSubheading">1. Intermittent fasting</div>
                <div className="weightLossSubIntro">Intermittent fasting is a dietary strategy that cycles between periods of fasting and eating.<br/><br/>

Various forms exist, including the 16/8 method, which involves limiting your calorie intake to 8 hours per day, and the 5:2 method, which restricts your daily calorie intake to 500–600 calories twice per week. <br/><br/>

How it works: Intermittent fasting restricts the time you’re allowed to eat, which is a simple way to reduce your calorie intake. This can lead to weight loss — unless you compensate by eating too much food during allowed eating periods.<br/><br/>

Weight loss: In a review of studies, intermittent fasting was shown to cause 3–8% weight loss over 3–24 weeks, which is a significantly greater percentage than other methods (2Trusted Source).<br/><br/>

The same review showed that this way of eating may reduce waist circumference by 4–7%, which is a marker for harmful belly fat (2Trusted Source).

Other studies found that intermittent fasting can increase fat burning while preserving muscle mass, which can improve metabolism (3Trusted Source, 4Trusted Source).</div>
           
           
<div className="weightLossSubheading">2. Plant-based diets</div>
<div className="weightLossSubIntro">Plant-based diets may help you lose weight. Vegetarianism and veganism are the most popular versions, which restrict animal products for health, ethical, and environmental reasons.<br/><br/>

However, more flexible plant-based diets also exist, such as the flexitarian diet, which is a plant-based diet that allows eating animal products in moderation.<br/><br/>

How it works: There are many types of vegetarianism, but most involve eliminating all meat, poultry, and fish. Some vegetarians may likewise avoid eggs and dairy.<br/><br/>

The vegan diet takes it a step further by restricting all animal products, as well as animal-derived products like dairy, gelatin, honey, whey, casein, and albumin.<br/><br/>

There are no clear-cut rules for the flexitarian diet, as it’s a lifestyle change rather than a diet. It encourages eating mostly fruits, vegetables, legumes, and whole grains but allows for protein and animal products in moderation, making it a popular alternative.</div>
           
<div className="weightLossSubheading">3. Low-carb diets</div>
<div className="weightLossSubIntro">Low-carb diets are among the most popular diets for weight loss. Examples include the Atkins diet, ketogenic (keto) diet, and low-carb, high-fat (LCHF) diet.<br/><br/>

Some varieties reduce carbs more drastically than others. For instance, very-low-carb diets like the keto diet restrict this macronutrient to under 10% of total calories, compared with 30% or less for other types (18Trusted Source).<br/><br/>

How it works: Low-carb diets restrict your carb intake in favor of protein and fat.<br/><br/>

They’re typically higher in protein than low-fat diets, which is important, as protein can help curb your appetite, raise your metabolism, and conserve muscle mass (19Trusted Source, 20Trusted Source).<br/><br/>

In very-low-carb diets like keto, your body begins using fatty acids rather than carbs for energy by converting them into ketones. This process is called ketosis (21Trusted Source).

</div>

<div className="weightLossSubheading">4. The paleo diet</div>
<div className="weightLossSubIntro">The paleo diet advocates eating the same foods that your hunter-gatherer ancestors allegedly ate.<br/><br/>

It’s based on the theory that modern diseases are linked to the Western diet, as proponents believe that the human body hasn’t evolved to process legumes, grains, and dairy.<br/><br/>

How it works: The paleo diet advocates eating whole foods, fruits, vegetables, lean meats, nuts, and seeds. It restricts the consumption of processed foods, grains, sugar, and dairy, though some less restrictive versions allow for some dairy products like cheese.<br/><br/>

Weight loss: Numerous studies have shown that the paleo diet can aid weight loss and reduce harmful belly fat (34Trusted Source, 35Trusted Source, 36Trusted Source).<br/><br/>

For example, in one 3-week study, 14 healthy adults following a paleo diet lost an average of 5.1 pounds (2.3 kg) and reduced their waist circumference — a marker for belly fat — by an average of 0.6 inches (1.5 cm) (37Trusted Source).<br/>

</div>

<div className="weightLossSubheading">5. Low-fat diets</div>
<div className="weightLossSubIntro">In general, a low-fat diet involves restricting your fat intake to 30% of your daily calories.<br/><br/>

Some very- and ultra-low-fat diets aim to limit fat consumption to under 10% of calories (24Trusted Source).<br/><br/>

How it works: Low-fat diets restrict fat intake because fat provides about twice the number of calories per gram, compared with the other two macronutrients — protein and carbs.<br/><br/>

Ultra-low-fat diets contain fewer than 10% of calories from fat, with approximately 80% of calories coming from carbs and 10% from protein.<br/><br/>

Ultra-low-fat diets are mainly plant-based and limit meat and animal products.<br/><br/>

Weight loss: As low-fat diets restrict calorie intake, they can aid weight loss (42Trusted Source, 43Trusted Source, 44Trusted Source, 45Trusted Source).<br/><br/>

An analysis of 33 studies including over 73,500 participants found that following a low-fat diet led to small but relevant changes in weight and waist circumference (42Trusted Source).

<div className="weightLossSubIntro">Although it was popularly believed that it is difficult to lose weight at home, this need not be true. The right kind of diet plan and workout routine is key here.
